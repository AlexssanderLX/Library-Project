# Library Project

This is a beginner-level study project developed in C# during my early learning
phase. The goal of this project was to practice basic programming logic and have
a first contact with Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Practice basic C# syntax
- Work with simple classes and methods
- Understand program flow and logic

## 🛠️ Technologies
- C#
- .NET
- Visual Studio

## 📌 Notes
This project was created as an introductory exercise.  
It uses minimal OOP concepts and focuses mainly on logic rather than architecture,
best practices, or scalability.
